## Description

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and most straightforward encryption techniques. This project allows you to both encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher.

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository or download the `caesar_cipher.py` file.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the **caesar_cipher.py file**.

3. Run the caesar_cipher.py file:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to either encode or decode a message. Enter the message and the shift number (the number of positions to shift the letters).
